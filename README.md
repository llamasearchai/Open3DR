## API Documentation

The platform provides RESTful APIs for medical data processing:

- **Medical Diagnostics**: `/api/v1/medical/diagnostics/`
- **Medical Imaging**: `/api/v1/medical/imaging/`  
- **Drug Discovery**: `/api/v1/medical/drug-discovery/`
- **Patient Monitoring**: `/api/v1/medical/patient-monitoring/`
- **Clinical Decisions**: `/api/v1/medical/clinical-decision/`
- **Medical Research**: `/api/v1/medical/research/`

WebSocket endpoints for real-time communication:
- **Live Monitoring**: `/ws/medical/live-monitoring/{patient_id}`
- **Medical Collaboration**: `/ws/medical/medical-collaboration/{room_id}`
- **Alert System**: `/ws/medical/medical-alerts`
- **Real-time Analysis**: `/ws/medical/real-time-analysis`

## Configuration

The platform uses Hydra for configuration management. Key configuration files:

- `config/medical_config.yaml` - Medical AI model settings
- `config/imaging_config.yaml` - 3D imaging and reconstruction
- `config/security_config.yaml` - HIPAA compliance and security
- `config/api_config.yaml` - API endpoints and authentication

## Testing
